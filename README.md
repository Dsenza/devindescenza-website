# Backend API Challenges

#Timestamp Micro Server
User Story

-I can pass a string as a parameter, and it will check to see whether that string contains either a unix timestamp or a natural language date (example: October 5, 1984)
-If it does, it returns both a Unix timestamp and the natural language form of that date.
-If the parameter is not a valid date, it returns null for both properties.
